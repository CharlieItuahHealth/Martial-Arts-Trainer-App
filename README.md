The Martial Arts Sports Trainer features a beautiful, modern dark-themed interface with smooth animations. It includes sections for:

Home: A welcoming introduction.
Techniques: A browsable library of martial arts move.
Workouts: A collection of training routines.
Timer: An interval timer with sound cues, perfect for training sessions.
The app is focused on a clean design, responsive layout, and engaging animations for UI elements and section transitions. I used Tailwind CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, including sound effects for the timer using Tone.js.
